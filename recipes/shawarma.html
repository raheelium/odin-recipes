    Description
  </h1>
  <p>
    Shawarma is a Levantine Arab dish consisting of meat cut into thin slices,
    stacked in a cone-like shape, and roasted on a slowly-turning vertical
      rotisserie or spit. Originally made with lamb, mutton or chicken, today's
      shawarma may also be turkey, beef, or veal.
  </p>
  <p>
    Shawarma is prepared from thin cuts of seasoned marinated lamb, mutton, 
    veal, beef, chicken, or turkey. The slices are stacked on a skewer about 
    60 cm (20 in) high. Lamb fat may be added to provide extra fat for juiciness 
    and flavor. A motorized spit slowly turns the stack of meat in front of 
    a heating element, continuously roasting the outer layer. Shavings are 
    cut off the rotating stack for serving, customarily with a long, sharp 
    knife.

      Steps
    </h1>
    <ol>
      <li><p> Make the tahini sauce. To make the tahini sauce, all you have to do is combine the garlic and lemon juice in a medium bowl and let it sit for 5 minutes. Then, you can whisk in the tahini, olive oil, yogurt, and ¾ teaspoon of salt until the mixture is smooth. If the mixture feels too thick to pour, then you can add another 1 or 2 tablespoons (14.8 or 29.6 ml) of water and mix it in to make it a bit thinner.

        You can make the sauce while you’re cooking your chicken, lamb, beef, veal, or other meat, if you want to save time.
        Additionally, you can make the sauce two days in advance and store it in the fridge until it’s ready to be used.
    </p></li>
    <li><p> Make the pickled cabbage. Pickled cabbage is another important ingredient to making a tasty shawarma. All you have to do to make it is to heat a bit of oil in a 10-inch skillet over medium heat. Add your cabbage and cook it for about 8-10 minutes, until it’s good and tender. You can stir it occasionally as you do this to make sure it’s evenly cooked. Then, remove it from the heat and add the pomegranate molasses, vinegar, and sugar. Once you do that, just season it to taste with a bit more vinegar or sugar, as well as salt and pepper.

      You can make the cabbage while you’re cooking the meat, if you’d like to save time. Alternatively, you can make it up to two days in advance and store it in the fridge until you’re ready to use it.
  
  </p></li>
  <li><p> Prepare your flatbread. You can use pita, yufka, marfouk, or even a flour tortilla for a shawarma. If you’re using flatbreads that you bought in the store or have made them ahead of time, then just warm them in a deep skillet over medium heat for a minute or two. You should do this right after you’ve finished preparing the meat so that you can place the meat into a shawarma that is nice and warm.

    Note that, after you’ve added your meat, tahini sauce, and cabbage to the shawarma, you can cook it, seam side-down, for about 3 minutes in a skillet to get it nice and brown and to seal the ingredients together.

</p></li>
<li><p> Mix the spices together in a bowl. Use a medium-sized plastic bowl for mixing together the garlic powder, paprika, nutmeg, cardamon, and cinnamon. Stir the spices for at least 30 seconds so you have fully mixed them together. </p></li>
